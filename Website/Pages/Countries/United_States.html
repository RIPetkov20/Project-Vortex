						<h2>The USA during WW1</h2>
							<p>The American Civil War was the largest military conflict in the Western world between
							the Napoleonic Wars and World War I. It cost 600,000 American lives, more than in World
							War I and World War II combined. Its social consequences were especially far-reaching.
							The war resulted in the emancipation of four million enslaved African Americans. It also
							brought vast changes to the nation's financial system, fundamentally altered the relationship
							between the states and the federal government, and became modern history's first total war.
							It is truly the central event in American history. This section describes the problems that 
							contributed to the breakup of the Democratic Party in 1860; why Abraham Lincoln's election 
							as president prompted secession; compares and contrasts the strengths and weaknesses of the 
							North and South as the Civil War started as well as the military leaders and strategies of 
							the North and the Confederacy. It also describes the circumstances that led President Lincoln 
							to issue the Emancipation Proclamation; the military history of the war; as well as the dramatic 
							political, economic, and social changes that the war produced.

						<h2>The USA during WW1</h2>
						<p>	The United States declared war on the German Empire on April 6, 1917, almost three years 
							after the start of World War I. On November 11, 1918, an armistice and a truce were declared. 
							Prior to its entry into the war, the United States had remained neutral, although it was a major 
							supplier to the United Kingdom, France, and the other World War I powers. The United States made the 
							largest contribution in the form of supplies, raw materials, and money beginning in 1917. American 
							soldiers under General of the Armies John Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary
							Force, arrived on the Western Front in the summer of 1918 at the rate of 10 thousand men a day. During 
							the war, the United States mobilized over 4 million troops and lost 65 thousand men. During the war, 
							in an effort to focus the war effort, the United States government expanded dramatically, greatly 
							increasing the size of the U.S. Armed Forces.

						<h2>The Great Depression in the USA</h2>
							<p>The Great Depression was steeper and more protracted in the United States than in other industrialized
							countries. The unemployment rate rose higher and remained higher longer than in any other western
							country. As it deepened, the Depression had far-reaching political consequences. The Depression
							vastly expanded the scope and scale of the federal government and created the modern welfare state.
							It gave rise to a philosophy that the federal government should provide a safety net for the elderly,
							the jobless, the disabled, and the poor, and that the federal government was responsible for ensuring 
							the health of the nation's economy and the welfare of its citizens. The stock market crash of October
							1929 brought the economic prosperity of the 1920s to a symbolic end. For the next ten years, the United
							States was mired in a deep economic depression. By 1933, unemployment had soared to 25 percent, up from
							3.2 percent in 1929. Industrial production declined by 50 percent, international trade plunged 30 percent,
							and investment fell 98 percent.</p>

						<h2>The USA during WW2</h2>
							<p>On December 7, 1941, after the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States declared war on Japan.
							Three days later, after Germany and Italy declared war on them, the United States fully entered World War II.
							The entry of the United States into World War II was quickly followed by massive mobilization. While millions
							of men and women served in the nation's armed forces overseas, most of those at home devoted themselves to 
							supporting the war effort with whatever resources were available to them. Women who had worked as homemakers
							or were outside the military industry took jobs in aircraft factories, munitions plants, factories making military 
							uniforms, and so on. Americans also supported the war effort with their hard-earned money by buying Liberty Bonds.
							The bonds sold by the U.S. government raised money for the war and made buyers feel that they were doing their 
							part for the war effort. The U.S. entry into the war helped get the country's economy back on its feet after 
							the Depression. Whereas ten years earlier it had been very difficult to find a job, now there was one for almost
							everyone who wanted one.  On May 8, 1945, Germany surrendered. After dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima 
							and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered on September 2, 1945, and World War II was over. The war cost the lives of 
							more than 330,000 American soldiers. Many more were permanently injured or maimed.</p>

						<h2>The USA after WW2</h2>
						<p>Following World War II, the United States began an economic boom that brought unparalleled prosperity to 
						a majority of its citizens and raised Americans expectations, breeding a belief that most economic and social
						problems could be solved. Among the crucial themes of this period were the struggle for equality among women 
						and minorities, and the backlash that these struggles evoked; the growth of the suburbs, and the shift in power
						from the older industrial states and cities of the Northeast and upper Midwest to the South and West; and the 
						belief that the U.S. had the economic and military power to maintain world peace and shape the behavior of other nations.</p>
