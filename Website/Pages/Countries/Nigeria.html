						<h2>Independent Nigeria</h2>
						<p>
							Nigeria was granted independence on October 1, 1960. A new constitution established a federal system with an elected prime minister and a ceremonial 
							head of state. The NCNC, now headed by Azikiwe (who had taken control after Macaulay's death in 1946), formed a coalition with Balew's NPC after 
							neither party won a majority in the 1959 elections. Balewa continued to serve as the prime minister, a position he had held since 1957, while Azikiwe 
							took the largely ceremonial position of president of the Senate. Following a UN-supervised referendum, the northern part of the Trust Territory of the 
							Cameroons joined the Northern region in June 1961, while in October the Southern Cameroons united with Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of 
							Cameroon. On October 1, 1963, Nigeria became a republic. Azikiwe became president of the country, although as prime minister Balewa was still more 
							powerful.

						<h2>The civil war of Nigeria</h2>
						<p>
							On May 30, 1967, Ojukwu declared the secession of the three states of the Eastern region under the name of the Republic of Biafra, which the federal 
							government interpreted as an act of rebellion. Fighting broke out in early July and within weeks had escalated into a full-scale civil war. In August 
							Biafran troops crossed the Niger, seized Benin City, and were well on their way to Lagos before they were checked at Ore, a small town in Western 
							state (now Ondo state). Shortly thereafter, federal troops entered Enugu, the provisional capital of Biafra, and penetrated the Igbo heartland. 
							The next two years were marked by stiff resistance in the shrinking Biafran enclave and by heavy casualties among civilians as well as in both 
							armies, all set within what threatened to be a military stalemate. Peacemaking attempts by the Organization of African Unity (now the African 
							Union) remained ineffective, while Biafra began earning recognition from African states and securing aid from international organizations for 
							what was by then a starving population.

						<h2>The Second Republic</h2>
						<p>
							Obasanjo pursued Mohammed's desire to return the country to civilian rule. As a first step, a new constitution was promulgated that replaced the 
							British-style parliamentary system with a presidential one. The president was invested with greater power but could assume office only after winning 
							one-fourth of the votes in two-thirds of the states in the federation. Many political parties emerged, but only five were registered: the National 
							Party of Nigeria (NPN), the Unity Party of Nigeria, the People's Redemption Party (PRP), the Great Nigeria People's Party, and the Nigeria People's 
							Party. All promised to improve education and social services, provide welfare, rebuild the economy and support private industry, and pursue a radical, 
							anti-imperialist foreign policy. The PRP was notable for expressing socialist ideas and rhetoric. Shehu Shagari, the candidate of the dominant party, 
							the right-wing NPN, narrowly won the 1979 presidential election, defeating Chief Obafemi Awolowo.

						<h2>Military regimes, 1983 - 1999</h2>
						<p>
							Buhari justified his coup and subsequent actions by citing the troubles of the Second Republic and the declining economy. The regime declared a 
							“War Against Indiscipline” (WAI), which resulted in the arrest, detention, and jailing of a number of politicians. When the WAI was extended to 
							journalists and others not responsible for the social decay and economic problems, the government's popularity began to wane. Gen. Ibrahim Babangida 
							assumed power following a bloodless coup in August 1985. Babangida at first presented to the public and the media the image of an affectionate and 
							considerate leader. He released political detainees and promised that public opinion would influence his decisions and those of the Armed Forces 
							Ruling Council, the supreme governing body. The public, however, demanded an end to military rule. Babangida outwardly supported a return to civilian 
							government but worked to undermine the process in order to retain power.

						<h2>The 1999 elections</h2>
						<p>
							After Abacha's death, political activity blossomed as numerous parties were formed. Of these, three emerged that were able to contest elections: the 
							People's Democratic Party (PDP), the Alliance for Democracy, and the All People's Party. A series of elections were held in January-March 1999 in 
							which councillors for local governments, legislatures for state and federal assemblies, and state governors were selected. The presidential election 
							took place in February and was carefully monitored by an international team of observers. Olusegun Obasanjo of the PDP, who as head of state in 
							1976-79 had overseen the last transition from military rule, was declared the winner.
