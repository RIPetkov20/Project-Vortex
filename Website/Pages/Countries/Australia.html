						<h2>1788 – First Fleet and Convicts</h2>
						<p>
							The Dutch first sighted Australia in 1606 before Captain Cook claimed the land for Great Britain in 1770. The First Fleet of 11 boats arrived at Botany 
							Bay in 1788 to establish New South Wales as a penal colony (receiving convicts until 1848). Convicts were later sent to the other states, with the 
							exception of South Australia, which was established as a free colony in 1836. Over 162,000 convicts were transported to Australia from Great Britain, 
							the majority to New South Wales and Tasmania.

						<h2>A major shift: 1830–1860</h2>
						<p>
							Four of Australia’s six states were formed between 1829 and 1859. A British naval captain, James Stirling, examined the Swan River in 1827 and 
							interested English capitalist-adventurers in colonization. Two years later he returned to the Swan as governor of the new colony of Western 
							Australia. The Colonial Office discouraged schemes for massive proprietorial grants; still the idea persisted, with Thomas Peel—kinsman of 
							the future prime minister Sir Robert Peel—investing heavily. But colonization was grim work in a hot, dry land, with the government reluctant 
							to expend resources. Western Australia’s story for decades was survival, not success. All the colonies except Western Australia gained 
							responsible self-government. New South Wales led the way when an imperial act of 1842 created a two-thirds elective legislature. The Australian 
							Colonies Government Act (1850) extended this situation to Victoria, South Australia, and Tasmania.

						<h2>Australia during WW1</h2>
						<p>
							Australia's involvement in World War I began when Britain and Germany entered the war on the fourth of August 1914. Both Prime Minister 
							Joseph Cook and Opposition Leader Andrew Fisher, in the midst of election campaigns, pledged their full support to Britain. The outbreak 
							of war was greeted with great enthusiasm in Australia, as in many other countries. On April 25, 1915, members of the Australian Imperial 
							Force, along with troops from New Zealand, France, and Britain, landed on Gallipoli in Turkey. This began a campaign that ended in December 
							1915 with the evacuation of Allied troops. The following year, Australian troops fought on the Western and Middle East fronts. In 1916 and 
							1917, gains were small and losses on the Western Front were high. In 1918, the Australians reached the peak of their combat performance at 
							the Battle of Hamel on July 4. They then participated in a series of decisive advances from August 8 until they were relieved in early 
							October. Germany surrendered on November 11, 1918.

						<h2>Australia during WW2</h2>
						<p>
							On September 3, 1939, Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies announced the beginning of Australia's participation in World War II. Nearly one 
							million Australians served in World War II. They fought in campaigns against Italy and Germany in Europe, North Africa, and the Mediterranean, 
							and against Japan in Southeast Asia and other parts of the Pacific. The Australian mainland was attacked directly for the first time when 
							Japanese aircraft bombed cities in northwestern Australia. On May 7, 1945, the German High Command authorised the signing of an unconditional 
							surrender on all fronts. The surrender was to take effect at midnight on May 8-9, 1945. On August 14, 1945, Japan accepted the Allied demand 
							for unconditional surrender. For Australia, this meant that the war was finally over.

						<h2>Australia after WW2</h2>
						<p>
							World War II generated economic vigour that continued into the 1970s. While some groups suffered disadvantages, that period, the 1960s especially, 
							ranked as something of a golden age. The population nearly doubled by 1976, with expenditure per head increasing by roughly the same proportion. 
							This prosperity reflected the general Western experience and depended much upon the export of basic commodities—notably wool in the 1950s and 
							minerals thereafter. Domestic manufacturing also expanded remarkably and with considerable sophistication: manufactured goods included iron and 
							steel wares, electric and electronic goods, and automobiles (production of “Australia’s own car,” the Holden, began in 1948). Output per worker 
							increased, and working hours were lessened.
