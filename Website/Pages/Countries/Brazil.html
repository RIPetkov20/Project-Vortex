						<h2>Royal governors, Jesuits, and slaves</h2>
							<p>King John III resolved to strengthen his authority in Brazil by unifying the inefficient donatários under a central administration. 
								He appointed as governor-general Tomé de Sousa, a Portuguese noble with impressive experience in Africa and India. Sousa landed in Brazil 
								in 1549 and founded Salvador (Bahia), a capital from which Brazil was governed for 214 years. Sousa also placed local officials over the 
								captaincies and fortified strategic points along the coast. In the cities, he established municipal organizations similar to those in Portugal. 
								Brazil then began to attract settlers in increasing numbers. By 1600 Bahia and Pernambuco each had a population of roughly 2,000 Europeans and 
								more than twice as many African slaves and Indians.</p>

						<h2>Agriculture and prospecting</h2>
						<p>Brazil's society and economy were based on agriculture and mining, especially the export-oriented production of sugar and gold. The sugar industry, 
							confined primarily to the Northeast, was the principal source of Brazilian wealth from the 16th to the 18th century, and it provided the crown with 
							most of its revenue through the time of independence. Sugar production called for major investments in land, labour (i.e., slaves), and machinery; 
							consequently, a relatively small number of wealthy, plantation-owning families controlled the industry. Small landholders produced cotton and coffee, 
							which became major exports in the 18th century. Independent freemen living near the sugar plantations raised tobacco and cattle, products that also 
							became prominent by the end of the colonial period.</p>

						<h2>Independence of Brazil</h2>
						<p>Brazil entered nationhood with considerably less strife and bloodshed than did the Spanish-speaking nations of the New World; however, the transition 
							was not entirely peaceful. José Joaquim da Silva Xavier, popularly known as Tiradentes (“Tooth Puller”), instigated in 1789 the first rebellion against 
							the Portuguese, who defeated his forces, executed him, and unwittingly made him a national hero in his martyrdom. The French revolutionary and 
							Napoleonic wars deeply affected Brazil, although the main events of those conflicts unfolded across the Atlantic. In 1807 Napoleon I invaded Portugal, 
							a British ally, largely to tighten the European blockade of Great Britain. The Portuguese prince regent Dom João (later King John VI [João VI]) decided 
							to take refuge in Brazil, making it the only colony to serve as the seat of government for its mother country. The prince, the royal family, and a horde 
							of nobles and functionaries left Portugal on November 29, 1807, under the protection of the British fleet. After several delays, they arrived at Rio 
							de Janeiro on March 7, 1808.</p>

						<h2>Transition to civilian rule</h2>
							<p>Manuel Deodoro da Fonseca, who had led the coup, became provisional president of the military-led government with the support of the nascent 
								middle class and the prosperous coffee planters. He established a republic, separated the powers of church and state, and on February 24, 1891, 
								promulgated a new constitution that combined elements of presidential, federal, democratic, and republican forms of government. The new states 
								of the republic exercised more power than had the empire's provinces. Congress elected Fonseca president later that year, but he proved unable to 
								govern under the new constitution. When he attempted to dissolve the dissenting Congress and rule by decree, the public raised such an outcry that 
								he was forced to resign. Floriano Peixoto, the equally militaristic vice president, ascended to office on November 23, defeated several monarchist 
								and military revolts, and restored a measure of tranquillity and order to the nation.</p>

						<h2>Collor, corruption, and inflation</h2>
						<p>Brazil's old-regime elites and military continued to inhibit reform of the political system in the early 1990s, while the country's voters became 
							disaffected and cynical, and the political parties remained superficial, depending on personality cults rather than platforms that addressed specific 
							problems. In the final round of the 1989 elections, Fernando Collor de Mello of the small National Reconstruction Party faced Luiz Inácio Lula da 
							Silva, known by his nickname Lula, of the Workers' Party (Partido dos Trabalhadores; PT), which presented an uncommonly well-articulated platform and 
							a clearly socialist ideology. Collor nevertheless gained the support of most of the parties of the Sarney government and campaigned for economic growth, 
							modernization, and eliminating government corruption and inefficiency. Although roughly one-fifth of the votes cast were abstentions or were nullified, 
							Collor was declared the clear winner, and he took office in March 1990.</p>
