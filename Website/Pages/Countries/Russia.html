						<h2>Peter I's successors (1725-1762)</h2>
						<p>
							Peter's unexpected death in 1725 at age 52 left unresolved two major institutional problems. The first was the succession to the throne, which 
							remained unsettled not only because Peter did not choose his own successor but also because during the remainder of the century almost any powerful 
							individual or group could disregard the choice of the preceding ruler. The second problem was the lack of firm central direction, planning, and 
							control of imperial policy; closely related to it was the question of who would have the determining role in shaping policy (i.e., what would be 
							the nature of the “ruling circle” and its relationship to the autocrat). The failure to solve these problems produced a climate of instability and 
							led to a succession of crises in St. Petersburg and Moscow that make it difficult to give unity to the period from 1725 until the accession of 
							Catherine II (the Great) in 1762.

						<h2>The revolution of 1905-1906</h2>
						<p>
							The Russo-Japanese War brought a series of Russian defeats on land and sea, culminating in the destruction of the Baltic fleet in the Tsushima Strait. 
							The defeat finally brought to a head a variety of political discontents simmering back at home. First the professional strata, especially in the 
							zemstvos and municipalities, organized a banquet campaign in favour of a popularly elected legislative assembly. Then, on January 9 
							(January 22, New Style), 1905, the St. Petersburg workers, led by the priest Georgy Gapon (leader of the Assembly of Russian Factory Workers), marched 
							on the Winter Palace to present Emperor Nicholas with a loyal petition containing similar but wider-ranging demands. They were met by troops who opened 
							fire on them, and about 130 were killed.

						<h2>The Stalin era (1928-1953)</h2>
						<p>
							Stalin, a Georgian, surprisingly turned to “Great Russian” nationalism to strengthen the Soviet regime. During the 1930s and '40s he promoted certain 
							aspects of Russian history, some Russian national and cultural heroes, and the Russian language, and he held the Russians up as the elder brother for 
							the non-Slavs to emulate. Industrialization developed first and foremost in Russia. Collectivization, though, met with considerable resistance in 
							rural areas. Ukraine in particular suffered harshly at Stalin's hands because of forced collectivization. He encountered strenuous resistance there, 
							for which he never forgave the Ukrainians. His policies thereafter brought widespread starvation to that republic, especially in 1932-33, when 
							possibly millions may have died. Nevertheless, many party officials from Ukraine came to Moscow to make their careers, among them Nikita S. 
							Khrushchev, who would succeed Stalin. The armed forces were dominated by Russians and Ukrainians, but the upper echelons of the Communist Party 
							did not contain as many Ukrainians as might have been expected, given the size of that republic. The political police, on the other hand, had many 
							non-Russians at the top, especially Georgians and Armenians.

						<h2>The Khrushchev era (1953-1964)</h2>
						<p>
							After Stalin's death in 1953, a power struggle for leadership ensued, which was won by Nikita Khrushchev. His landmark decisions in foreign policy and 
							domestic programs markedly changed the direction of the Soviet Union, bringing détente with the West and a relaxation of rigid controls within the 
							country. Khrushchev, who rose under Stalin as an agricultural specialist, was a Russian who had grown up in Ukraine. During his reign Ukrainians 
							prospered in Moscow. He took it for granted that Russians had a natural right to instruct less-fortunate nationals. This was especially evident in 
							the non-Slavic republics of the U.S.S.R. and in eastern and southeastern Europe. His nationality policies reversed the repressive policies of Stalin. 
							He grasped the nettle of the deported nationalities and rehabilitated almost all of them; the accusations of disloyalty made against them by Stalin 
							were declared to be false. This allowed many nationalities to return to their homelands within Russia, the Volga Germans being a notable exception.

						<h2>The Brezhnev era (1964-1982)</h2>
						<p>
							After Khrushchev came the triumvirate of Leonid I. Brezhnev, Aleksey N. Kosygin, and N.V. Podgorny. The first was the party leader, the second 
							headed the government, and the third became chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, a ceremonial position. By the late 1960s Brezhnev 
							was clearly the dominant leader. His strengths were in manipulating party and government cadres, but he was weak on policy ideas. Brezhnev ensured 
							that there was an unprecedented stability of cadres within the Communist Party and the bureaucracy, thereby creating conditions for the rampant 
							spread of corruption in the Soviet political and administrative structures. However, under Brezhnev the U.S.S.R. reached its apogee in the 
							mid-1970s: it acquired nuclear parity with the United States and was recognized as a world superpower. Détente flourished in the 1970s but was 
							disrupted by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979.
