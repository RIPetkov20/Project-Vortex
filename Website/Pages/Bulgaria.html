		<p>After the disintegration of Greater Bulgaria, which was located in the
		lands of present-day Ukraine, some of them, led by Asparuh and others led
		by Kuber, moved to the Balkan Peninsula and merged with the Slavs who came
		from the north in the early seventh century. in turn they are mixed with
		the local Byzantines. After the leader of the Proto-Bulgarians Asparuh won
		a victory over one of the armies of Emperor Constantine IV, the then head
		of the Byzantine Empire concluded an agreement between Asparuh and the Byzantine
		emperor. According to this agreement, the proto-Bulgarians and the Slavs received
		most of the territory between the Balkan Mountains and the Danube. This marks the
		beginning of the creation of the emerging Bulgarian nation. The treaty with
		Byzantium from 681 is accepted as the moment of creation of the First Bulgarian
		state, while the year of creation of modern Bulgaria is 1878.</p>

		<p>The April Uprising of 1876 was an armed uprising of the Bulgarians in the
		Ottoman Empire. It erupted prematurely on April 20 in Koprivshtitsa and was 
		organized by the Giurgiu Revolutionary Committee. Although unsuccessful, it 
		is a kind of peak of the Bulgarian national liberation movement. Today's estimates
		are that the uprising, although unsuccessful, has achieved another major goal, the
		political one, as the popular uprising for independence resonates strongly in Western
		Europe and especially in Russia. The uprising was prepared in just 1-2 months, which
		explains the failures in the organization and its course. The decision to revolt was
		taken by individual BRCC activists, it was not supported by any external force and
		was ultimately the result of the efforts of several apostles. More serious
		preparations for the revolt were made only in the IV and I districts.</p>

		<p>The young Bulgarian officers, who yesterday commanded companies, companies
		and platoons, found themselves at the head of the Bulgarian army. Even the Chief of
		the General Staff Racho Petrov has the rank of captain. They are facing Serbian generals
		with extensive combat experience. The Serbian armed forces are moving towards the 
		Serbian-Bulgarian border. The Bulgarian command is developing a plan for the war, 
		which envisages, through the resistance of scattered squadrons, to delay the Serbian
		advance on Slivnitsa until reinforcements arrive from southern Bulgaria. of the parts
		of the Eastern Corps to counterattack. Active defense and maintenance of the Vidin Fortress
		is envisaged for the Vidin District. For the defense of Vidin, the Northern Detachment was
		formed under the command of Captain Atanas Uzunov.</p>

		<p>At the outbreak of the war, Bulgaria declared that it would maintain neutrality, but 
		"with rifles at its feet." Both military blocs are trying to win her over because of her
		important strategic location. In May 1915, the Entente promised Bulgaria, against its 
		immediate intervention, to receive after the end of the war Eastern Thrace to the line 
		Media - Enos, the "undisputed" and part of the "disputed" area in Macedonia, as well as 
		support in negotiations with Romania for South Dobrudja and a cash loan. The proposals 
		have not been agreed in advance with Serbia and Greece, which are strongly opposed to 
		ceding their territory.At the same time, Germany and Austria-Hungary guaranteed the 
		accommodation of Bulgarians in southern Serbia (Pomoravi) and throughout Serbian Macedonia 
		immediately after their conquest, immediate negotiations with Turkey for territorial 
		concessions, and the return of Bulgarian territories seized under the Bucharest Treaty 
		if Greece and Serbia join the enemy bloc.</p>

		<p>After Germany occupied much of Europe and failed in its attempt to impose air superiority
		over Britain, Adolf Hitler sent his troops east to the giant Soviet Union. Its inexhaustible
		resources will be needed by the Reich in the future. For the attack, Germany must secure its
		southern flank - the Balkans. Thus began the political and military pressure on the countries
		of the peninsula. Bulgaria initially tried to maintain neutrality, but the government of 
		Germanophile Bogdan Filov came to power. After Romania's accession to the Axis powers, the 
		pressure increased and on March 1, 1941, Bulgaria had no choice but to sign a protocol in 
		Vienna on its accession to the Tripartite Pact. The country provides us with its territory 
		and communications for the deployment of German troops preparing for its campaign in the Balkans. 
		Subsequent offensives led to the defeat and capitulation of Yugoslavia and Greece. Bulgarian 
		troops do not take part in them.</p>
